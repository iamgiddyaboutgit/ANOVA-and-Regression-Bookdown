# Preface {-}

This project is meant to be a personal guide to ANOVA and regression. The scope of this project does not include time series analysis. Also, the focus will not be on designing experiments, but rather on analyzing the data from experiments which have already been conducted. To accomplish this, we will use simulated experimental data.

**Disclaimer**  
This project was not written by an expert. That being said, I would appreciate any comments.

**Note**  
This book was constructed with the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown], which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
