Open the link above to access the webpage for this project.  This project is meant to be a personal guide to ANOVA and regression.  The scope of this project does not include time series analysis.  Also, the focus will not be on designing experiments, but rather on analyzing the data from experiments which have already been conducted.  To accomplish this, we will use simulated experimental data.
