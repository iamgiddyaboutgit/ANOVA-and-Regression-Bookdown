The scope of this project does not include time series analysis. Also, the focus will not be on designing experiments, but rather on analyzing the data from experiments which have already been conducted. To accomplish this, we will use simulated experimental data. Disclaimer This project was not written by an expert. That being said, I would appreciate any comments. Note This book was constructed with the bookdown package,1 which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr.2 References 1. Xie, Y. Bookdown: Authoring books and technical documents with r markdown.
